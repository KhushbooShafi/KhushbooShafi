# 👋 Hey there, I'm Khushboo! PhD Student @ KAIST (Data Science)  

> Climate–health time-series | DLNM + GLM | Reproducible R/Python pipelines | XAI & Computer Vision for biodiversity

Currently I am studing how seasonality and temperature shape health outcomes and how we can model these signals at scale. My work blends classical statistics with modern ML to build **transparent, reproducible** analyses. **Methods**: distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM), quasi-Poisson GLMs, cyclic B-splines, meta-analysis (fixed/random/mixed)  


## 🔭 Current focus
- **Climate–health seasonality at scale**  
  - City-level DLNM + GLM with seasonal splines, pooled to country level  
  - Reproducible pipelines with clear artifacts: `coef/`, `vcov/`, `pred/`, logs, and QA checks

- **Explainable CV for biodiversity**  
  - Lightweight CNN baselines → transfer learning → Grad-CAM/SHAP comparisons  
  - Curriculum-ready notebooks and clean inference scripts

**🔍 Always exploring: How can AI & data science be used for social good? 🌍**
